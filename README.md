# Focus

The goal of the Focus browser extension is to hide feeds, recommendations and other distractions while retaining maximal functionality for doing focussed work. On most sites, Focus will replace the feed on the frontpage with a search page.

### Supported Sites
- twitter.com
- youtube.com (also hides recommended videos)
- reddit.com
- instagram.com
- facebook.com
- messenger.com
- mail.google.com (only to auto-focus the search bar, nothing is hidden)

The extension can be disabled for each page individually using the buttons on the right edge of the page. To re-enable it click the button at the bottom left corner of the page.


### Tips
To show the original page you might have to click multiple times on the "show original page" button. This is done purposefully to increase friction. 


### Manual installation
- download and unpack the zip file from Github
- go to chrome://extensions
- select "Load unpacked" and select the `chrome-extension` directory from the unpacked zip file
