# Focus

Focus is an extension for the Chrome browser to replace the front pages from Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, etc with a search page and put keyboard focus on the search input field.


### Supported Sites
- twitter.com
- youtube.com (also hides recommended videos)
- reddit.com
- instagram.com
- facebook.com
- messenger.com


### Tips
To show the original page you might have to click multiple times on the "show original page" button. This is done purposefully to increase friction. 


### Manual installation
- download and unpack the zip file from Github
- go to chrome://extensions
- select "Load unpacked" and select the `chrome-extension` directory from the unpacked zip file
